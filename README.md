### Hi, I'm Samy Ahmed ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a recent Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in web and backend development. I love turning ideas into code and exploring new technologies to keep growing my skills.
I enjoy learning the tools that bring projects to life, and Iâ€™m excited to see where this journey in tech will take me.

When I'm not coding, Iâ€™m usually reading up on new programming concepts, finding ways to solve interesting problems. 
Iâ€™m here to connect, learn, and contribute to projects that make an impact!
